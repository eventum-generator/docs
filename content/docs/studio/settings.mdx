title: Settings and management
description: Application settings, secrets management, and server lifecycle controls in Eventum Studio.
---

Studio provides three administrative pages for configuring the application itself — **Settings** for application parameters, **Secrets** for encrypted credentials, and **Management** for server lifecycle controls.

## Settings

The Settings page is a form-based editor for the application configuration — the same parameters defined in [eventum.yml](/docs/core/config/eventum-yml). Changes made here are written back to the config file on disk.

The page is organized into four sections, accessible via the navigation on the right:

## Secrets

The Secrets page provides a visual interface for managing the encrypted keyring — the same secrets you would manage with the [`eventum-keyring`](/docs/core/cli/eventum-keyring) CLI tool.

/>

The page shows a table with three columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | The secret name (the key used in `${secrets.name}` tokens). |
| **Value** | The secret value, masked with asterisks by default. |
| **Actions** | Three buttons per row: **reveal** (<Eye className="inline" size={14} />), **edit** (<Pencil className="inline" size={14} />), and **delete** (<Trash2 className="inline" size={14} />). |

### Viewing secrets

Click the **reveal** (<Eye className="inline" size={14} />) button next to a secret to reveal its value. Click again to hide it.

### Editing secrets

Click the **edit** (<Pencil className="inline" size={14} />) button to edit an existing secret's value. The field becomes editable and you can save the updated value.

### Deleting secrets

Click the **delete** (<Trash2 className="inline" size={14} />) button to remove a secret from the keyring. This is irreversible — any generator configs referencing `${secrets.name}` for the deleted secret will fail to load until the secret is re-created.

### Adding a new secret

At the bottom of the table, two input fields let you add a new secret:

- **new secret name** — the name for the secret.
- **secret value** — the value to encrypt and store.

The value field has a **reveal** (<Eye className="inline" size={14} />) toggle and a **save** (<Save className="inline" size={14} />) button. After saving, the secret appears in the table above and is immediately available for use in generator configs.

## Management

The Management page provides server lifecycle controls — restart and shutdown.

/>

Three action buttons are available:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Show logs** | Opens the application-level log viewer (same as instance logs, but for the main application process). |
| **Restart** | All generators are stopped, the configuration is re-read, and generators are re-started according to the updated startup config. The web UI may be briefly unavailable during the restart. This is equivalent to sending `SIGHUP` to the process. |
| **Stop** | Stops the Eventum application entirely. All generators are shut down gracefully and the server process exits. **This is irreversible from the UI** — once stopped, you'll need to restart Eventum from the command line. |

<Callout type="warn">
The **Stop** button shuts down the entire Eventum process. You will lose access to Studio and will need to restart Eventum from the terminal with `eventum run -c eventum.yml`.
</Callout>
