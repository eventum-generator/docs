title: Eventum Studio
description: The built-in web interface for managing generators, editing configs, debugging events, and monitoring performance — all from your browser.
---

Eventum Studio is the web-based management UI that ships with Eventum. It gives you a visual interface for everything you can do through config files and the CLI — browsing projects, configuring plugins, debugging event output, monitoring running generators, and managing application settings.

Studio is served automatically when you run Eventum in application mode:

```bash
eventum run -c eventum.yml
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:9474 (or whichever host/port you configured).

## What you can do in Studio

| Area | What it covers |
|------|----------------|
| [Overview](/docs/studio/overview) | System dashboard — resource usage, flow statistics, instance status at a glance |
| [Instances](/docs/studio/instances) | Running and finished generators — start, stop, restart, view metrics and logs |
| [Projects](/docs/studio/projects) | Generator configs — visual editors for input, event, and output plugins with live preview |
| [Settings](/docs/studio/settings) | Application settings, secrets management, and server lifecycle controls |

## Enabling and disabling Studio

Studio is controlled by two settings in [eventum.yml](/docs/core/config/eventum-yml):

```yaml title="eventum.yml"
server:
  ui_enabled: true    # enables the web UI
  api_enabled: true   # enables the REST API (required for Studio to function)
```

Setting `ui_enabled: false` disables the web interface while keeping the REST API available. Setting `api_enabled: false` disables both — Studio needs the API to communicate with the backend.

## Authentication

Studio uses HTTP basic authentication. The default credentials are:

| Field | Default |
|-------|---------|
| Username | `eventum` |
| Password | `eventum` |

Change these in `eventum.yml` before exposing Eventum on a network:

```yaml title="eventum.yml"
server:
  auth:
    user: admin
    password: s3cret
```

## Theme

Studio supports light and dark themes. Toggle between them using the sun/moon icon in the top-right corner of the top bar. The theme preference is saved in the browser.
