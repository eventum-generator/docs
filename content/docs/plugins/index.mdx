Plugins are the building blocks of an Eventum [generator](/docs/core/concepts/generator). Every generator is a three-stage pipeline where each stage is handled by one or more plugins. This section is the **reference** for every available plugin — parameters, defaults, constraints, and configuration examples.

For the conceptual overview of how plugins fit together, see [Concepts — Plugins](/docs/core/concepts/plugins).

## Input plugins

Input plugins define **when** events happen. A generator can have multiple input plugins — their timestamp streams are merged chronologically.

Every input plugin supports an optional `tags` parameter that attaches string labels to timestamps, making them available in event templates via the `tags` variable.

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [cron](/docs/plugins/input/cron) | Cron expressions with second-level precision |
| [timer](/docs/plugins/input/timer) | Fixed-interval ticks |
| [linspace](/docs/plugins/input/linspace) | Evenly spaced timestamps across a date range |
| [static](/docs/plugins/input/static) | All at once, using the current time |
| [timestamps](/docs/plugins/input/timestamps) | An explicit list of datetimes |
| [time_patterns](/docs/plugins/input/time-patterns) | Statistical distributions that mimic real traffic |
| [http](/docs/plugins/input/http) | On demand, triggered by HTTP requests |

## Event plugins

Event plugins define **what** events look like. A generator has exactly one event plugin.

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [template](/docs/plugins/event/template) | Renders Jinja2 templates with Faker, Mimesis, random helpers, and more |
| [script](/docs/plugins/event/script) | Runs a Python function for full programmatic control |
| [replay](/docs/plugins/event/replay) | Reads events from an existing log file |

## Output plugins

Output plugins define **where** events go. A generator can have multiple output plugins — every event is delivered to all of them (fan-out).

Every output plugin supports a [formatter](/docs/plugins/formatters) that controls how events are serialized before delivery.

| Plugin | Default formatter | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| [stdout](/docs/plugins/output/stdout) | `plain` | Prints to the console or stderr |
| [file](/docs/plugins/output/file) | `plain` | Writes to a local file |
| [http](/docs/plugins/output/http) | `json-batch` | Sends to any HTTP endpoint |
| [opensearch](/docs/plugins/output/opensearch) | `json` | Indexes into an OpenSearch cluster |
| [clickhouse](/docs/plugins/output/clickhouse) | `json` | Inserts into a ClickHouse database |

## Configuration syntax

Each plugin is configured as a named key inside the corresponding section of [generator.yml](/docs/core/config/generator-yml). The key is the plugin name; the value holds plugin-specific parameters:

```yaml title="generator.yml"
input:
  - cron:              # plugin name
      expression: "* * * * * *"  # plugin parameter
      count: 1

event:
  template:
    mode: all
    templates:
      - my_event:
          template: templates/event.jinja

output:
  - stdout: {}         # empty config is valid
  - file:
      path: output/events.jsonl
      formatter:
        format: json
```

Rules:
- `input` and `output` are **lists** — each item is a single-key mapping naming one plugin.
- `event` is a **single mapping** — one plugin name with its config.
- Unknown fields cause a validation error before any events are generated.
- Relative paths are resolved from the directory containing the generator config file.
