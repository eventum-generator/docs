title: Overview
description: A map of the Core documentation — from first steps to advanced configuration.
---

This part of documentation covers everything you need for basic usage of Eventum: installing the tool, understanding its core abstractions, configuring generators, and running them from the command line.

If you're new to Eventum, start with **Introduction** to get up and running, then explore **Concepts** to understand how the pieces fit together. Once you're comfortable, **Configuration** and **CLI** give you full control over every detail.
