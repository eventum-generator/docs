description: Eventum 2.0.2 patch release — fix for reading generator configs with placeholders via API.
---

Released **February 21, 2026**

A patch release that fixes an issue with reading generator configs containing parameter and secret placeholders through the REST API.

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- **Generator config API** — fixed the GET endpoint returning a validation error when a generator config contained `${params.*}` or `${secrets.*}` placeholders. The endpoint now uses loose validation for reading configs while keeping strict validation for creating and updating.

## 🧪 Testing

- Added test for reading generator configs with placeholders via the API.

## 📝 Other changes

- Updated GitHub URLs in README and pyproject.toml to match the new organization.
- Improved release script with detailed usage instructions and phase handling.
