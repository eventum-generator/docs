The Overview page is the first thing you see when you open Studio. It provides a real-time snapshot of the system — resource consumption, event flow statistics, throughput charts, and the status of all generator instances.

## Performance

The top section displays four resource gauges:

| Gauge | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| **Memory usage** | Current and total RAM (e.g. 13.7 GB / 15.48 GB, 88%). |
| **CPU usage** | Number of cores and clock speed (e.g. 20 x 2995 MHz, 8%). |
| **Network usage** | Currently downloaded and uploaded bytes (e.g. 644.68 KB down, 50.06 MB up). |
| **Disk usage** | Currently written and read bytes (e.g. 20.47 GB write, 6.73 GB read). |

These values update in real time while the page is open.

## Flow stats

Below the performance gauges, five counters summarize the total event throughput across all generators:

| Counter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Generated** | Total number of timestamps generated by all input plugins. |
| **Produced** | Total number of events produced by event plugins from those timestamps. |
| **Written** | Total number of events successfully delivered by output plugins. |
| **Input EPS** | Current events per second at the input stage. |
| **Output EPS** | Current events per second at the output stage. |

The difference between Generated, Produced, and Written reflects events that were lost to produce failures, write failures, or events still in internal queues waiting to be processed.

## Charts

Two visualizations appear below the flow stats:

- **Instances by produced events** — a bar chart showing how many events each instance has produced. This helps you spot which generators are the most active and whether load is distributed as expected.
- **Instances by output EPS** — a pie chart showing the share of output throughput per instance. Useful for identifying which generators are consuming the most write bandwidth.

## Instances sidebar

The right-hand panel shows a summary of all registered generator instances:

- **Totals** — counts for Total, Active, Inactive, and Failed instances.
- **Recent instances** — a list of instances ordered by most recent activity, each showing:
  - Instance name and status indicator (green dot for Active, grey for Inactive).
  - A link to the instance's project for quick navigation.
  - Timestamp of the last status change.

This sidebar gives you a quick way to check whether all expected generators are running without leaving the dashboard.
