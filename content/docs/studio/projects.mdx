description: Generator projects in Studio — the project list, the visual plugin editor with input preview, event debugger, output formatter testing, and file management.
---

A **project** in Studio corresponds to a generator directory on disk — a [generator.yml](/docs/core/config/generator-yml) file and its supporting resources (templates, scripts, samples, pattern files). The Projects section lets you browse, create, and visually edit generator configurations without touching YAML directly.

## Project list

The Projects page shows all generator directories discovered under the configured `generators_dir` path.

  alt="Projects page in Eventum Studio"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

The table has the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Project Name** | The name of the generator directory. Click to open the project editor. |
| **Instances** | Badges showing which instances are using this project. A project with no instances shows "Not used". |
| **Modified** | When the project was last modified (relative time). |
| **Size** | Total size of all files in the project directory. |

### Filtering

- **Search by name** — text filter on project names.
- **Search by instance** — text filter on associated instance names.
- **Any used** — checkbox to show only projects that have at least one instance.

Click **Create new** to scaffold a new generator project.

Each row has a three-dot menu for actions like deleting or duplicating the project.

## Project editor

Clicking a project name opens the full-screen editor. The editor is divided into three main tabs — **Input plugins**, **Event plugin**, and **Output plugins** — matching the three stages of the [generator pipeline](/docs/core/concepts/generator#the-three-stage-pipeline).

All three tabs share a consistent layout:

- **Left sidebar** — plugin list and file tree.
- **Center workspace** — plugin-specific tools (preview, debugger, editor, formatter).
- **Right sidebar** — plugin parameters form.
- **Top right** — **Back** button to return to the project list, and **Save** button to persist changes to disk.

### File tree

The bottom-left panel on every tab shows the project's file tree — all files and directories inside the generator directory. Files are displayed with type-appropriate icons (templates, YAML configs, data files, markdown). You can browse the structure, select files to edit, upload and create new files and directories.

---

## Input plugins tab

The Input plugins tab lets you configure and preview input plugins — the scheduling stage that determines *when* events are generated.

  darkSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_input_plugins_tab_dark.png"
  alt="Input plugins tab in the project editor"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

### Plugin list

The left sidebar shows the configured input plugins (e.g. `time_patterns #1`). Click a plugin to select it. Use the **+** button to add a new input plugin.

### Plugin parameters

The right sidebar shows all parameters for the selected input plugin. The fields vary by plugin type — for example, a `time_patterns` plugin shows:

- **Patterns** — list of pattern files used by this plugin.
- **Tags** — string labels attached to every timestamp from this plugin.
- **Pattern editor** — select a pattern to edit, then configure its **Oscillator** (start time, end time, period, period unit), **Multiplier**, **Randomizer**, and **Spreader** sections in form fields.

For other plugin types (cron, timer, linspace, etc.), the right sidebar shows their respective parameters.

### Workspace — Preview

The center area provides a scheduling preview tool:

- **Number of timestamps** — how many timestamps to generate for the preview (e.g. 10000).
- **Time span** — bin width of preview histogram (e.g. "30s", "5m", "1h").
- **Timezone** — timezone for timestamp interpretation.
- **Selected plugin / All plugins** — toggle between previewing only the selected plugin or merging all input plugins together.
- **Skip past timestamps** — toggle to exclude timestamps that have already passed.

Click **Generate** to run the preview. The result is displayed as:

- **Distribution histogram** — a bar chart showing how timestamps are distributed over time. This is the fastest way to verify that your scheduling produces the expected traffic shape — daily peaks, uniform spacing, spiky bursts, etc.
- **Timestamps** — a raw list of the generated timestamps.

The histogram also shows the **Total count** at the bottom right.

## Event plugin tab

The Event plugin tab is where you configure and debug the event plugin — the stage that turns timestamps into event strings.

The tab has three workspace sub-tabs: **Debugger**, **State**, and **Editor**.

### Debugger

The debugger lets you produce events on demand and inspect the output before running a full generator.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_event_plugin_debugger_tab_light.png"
  darkSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_event_plugin_debugger_tab_dark.png"
  alt="Event plugin debugger tab in the project editor"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

At the top of the debugger workspace:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Event timestamp** | The timestamp to pass to the event plugin. Defaults to the current time with an **Auto** toggle that keeps it up to date. |
| **Tags** | Optional tags to pass alongside the timestamp (simulates tags from input plugins). |
| **Count** | How many events to produce in one run (e.g. 10). |

Two action buttons:

- **Stop** — stop the debugger.
- **Produce** — trigger event production with the current settings.

Below the controls, the **Events** section shows the produced output:

- **Syntax highlighting** — select the format (e.g. "json") for colored output.
- Each event is displayed in its own card with expand/collapse and copy buttons.

This is the fastest way to iterate on templates or scripts — change a template in the editor, re-start the debugger, click Produce, and immediately see the output. No need to start a full generator.

### State

The State tab exposes the event plugin's internal state — useful for debugging stateful templates that use `locals`, `shared`, or `globals`.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_event_plugin_state_tab_light.png"
  darkSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_event_plugin_state_tab_dark.png"
  alt="Event plugin state tab in the project editor"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

Three state scopes are displayed:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Local state** | State specific to the selected template. Each template has its own `locals` dictionary. |
| **Shared state** | State shared across all templates in this generator. Accessible as `shared` in templates. |
| **Global state** | State shared across all generators in the application. Accessible as `globals` in templates. |

Each scope shows the current state as a JSON object and provides three buttons:

- **Sync** — refresh the state from the backend (useful when a running instance has modified it).
- **Clear** — reset the state to an empty object.
- **Add** — add specified keys-values to state.

<Callout type="warn">
Modifying **Global state** from the State tab affects all currently running generator instances, not just the one you're editing. Use with caution.
</Callout>

### Editor

The Editor tab provides a code editor with syntax highlighting for the template, script or any other file.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_event_plugin_editor_tab_light.png"
  darkSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_event_plugin_editor_tab_dark.png"
  alt="Event plugin editor tab in the project editor"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

Editor features:

- **Tab bar** — open files as tabs (e.g. `templates/template.jinja`, `README.md`). Multiple files can be open simultaneously.
- **Syntax highlighting** — Jinja, Python, YAML, JSON, Markdown and other formats are highlighted.
- **Autocomplete** — basic intellisense is implemented for Jinja templates and Python scripts.


Changes are saved to disk when you press `Ctrl + S`.

## Output plugins tab

The Output plugins tab lets you configure output plugins and test their formatters.

  darkSrc="/images/studio_ui/project_page_output_plugins_tab_dark.png"
  alt="Output plugins tab in the project editor"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

### Workspace — Formatter

The center workspace provides a live formatter testing tool. The **Formatter** sub-tab shows:

- **Format** — dropdown to select the formatter type (e.g. `json-batch`, `plain`, `json`, `template`, `template-batch`).
- **Indent, ...** — parameters of the selected formatter.

Below the formatter settings, a two-column view lets you test formatting interactively:

- **Events** (left) — add sample events as text input. Each event is an editable card.
- **Formatted events** (right, under **Result**) — click **Format** to apply the formatter and see the transformed output.
- **Errors** — any formatting errors are displayed below the result.

This is a useful way to verify that your events are valid for the chosen formatter before running a full pipeline — especially for JSON formatters that will reject invalid JSON.
