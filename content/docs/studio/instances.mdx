description: Managing generator instances in Studio — the instance table, lifecycle controls, metrics dialog, and log viewer.
---

The Instances page is where you manage generator instances — the running (or finished) copies of your generator projects. Each instance represents a single execution of a generator with its own metrics, logs, and lifecycle.

## Instance table

The main area is a sortable, paginated table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Instance** | The unique ID of the instance (assigned in [startup.yml](/docs/core/config/startup-yml) or when creating a new instance). |
| **Project** | The generator project this instance is running. Links to the project editor. |
| **Status** | Current state — **Active** (green dot) for running instances, **Finished** (green dot) for instances that completed normally, **Failed** for instances that stopped due to an error. |
| **Last start time** | When the instance was most recently started (relative time, e.g. "2 minutes ago"). |

Columns are sortable — click any column header to sort ascending or descending.

### Filtering

Above the table, three filters help you narrow the list:

- **Search by instance** — text filter on instance IDs.
- **Search by project** — text filter on project names.
- **Running only** — checkbox to hide finished and failed instances.

## Creating an instance

Click the **Create new** button in the top right to register a new generator instance. You'll need to specify an instance ID and select which project it should run.

## Lifecycle controls

The toolbar next to the "Create new" button provides bulk actions for selected instances (use the checkboxes in each row):

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Delete** | Remove the selected instances from the startup configuration. |
| **Refresh** | Refresh status of the instances. |
| **Stop** | Stop the selected instances. Active generators are shut down gracefully. |
| **Start** | Start the selected instances. Only works on instances that are currently inactive. |

Each row also has a three-dot menu on the right for per-instance actions.

## Instance metrics

Clicking the metrics option on an instance opens a dialog with detailed runtime metrics.

  alt="Instance metrics dialog in Eventum Studio"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

The dialog has two sections:

### Common metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Instance** | Instance ID. |
| **Start time** | When the instance started (date and time). |
| **Uptime** | How long the instance has been running (in seconds). |
| **Generated** | Total timestamps generated by input plugins. |
| **Written** | Total events successfully delivered by output plugins. |
| **Input EPS** | Current input events per second. |
| **Output EPS** | Current output events per second. |

### Per-plugin metrics

Below the common section, metrics are broken down by each plugin in the pipeline:

- **Input plugins** — shows each input plugin (e.g. "timer #1") with its **Generated** count.
- **Event plugin** — shows the event plugin (e.g. "template #1") with **Produced** and **Produce failed** counts.
- **Output plugins** — shows each output plugin (e.g. "clickhouse #1") with **Written**, **Format failed**, and **Write failed** counts.

These per-plugin counters make it easy to pinpoint which stage is dropping events.

## Instance settings

Opening an instance's settings shows the full configuration for that specific instance — the same fields available in [startup.yml](/docs/core/config/startup-yml), presented as a form.

  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

### Generator parameters

The top section controls the instance's execution behavior:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Live mode** | Toggle between live mode (real-time) and sample mode (as fast as possible). |
| **Skip past** | Whether to skip timestamps that have already passed when starting in live mode. |
| **Auto start** | Whether the instance starts automatically when Eventum launches. |
| **Parameters** | A JSON editor for key-value pairs substituted into the generator config via `${params.name}`. |

### Generation parameters

Below the generator parameters, the generation settings allow you to override the application-level defaults for this specific instance.

Click **Save** to persist changes. Changes take effect on the next start of the instance.

## Instance logs

The log viewer shows the runtime log output for a specific instance. This is the same information written to the log files on disk, but accessible directly in the browser.

  darkSrc="/images/studio_ui/instance_logs_dark.png"
  alt="Instance logs viewer in Eventum Studio"
  className="rounded-lg border mt-2"
/>

Logs are displayed as a scrollable text area with:

- Structured log entries showing timestamp, level (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR), message, and context fields.
- The full startup sequence — config loading, plugin initialization, generator start.
- Runtime events — generation progress, errors, and completion status.
