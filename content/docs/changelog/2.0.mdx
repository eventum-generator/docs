Released **February 23, 2026** 🎉

Eventum 2.0 is a complete rewrite from the ground up! New plugin-based architecture, batch processing, a built-in web UI, and much more. This is a major release — configurations from 1.x will need to be updated.

## 🚀 New features

### Input plugins

- **[`http`](/docs/plugins/input/http) input plugin** — trigger event generation from external systems via HTTP requests.
- **Live & sample modes** for all input plugins — run in real-time or generate as fast as possible.
- **Human-readable dates** — write `"January 1, 2025"`, `"+1h"`, or `"now"` instead of strict ISO formats.
- **Multiple input merging** — combine several input plugins in one generator, timestamps are merged automatically in chronological order.

### Event plugins

- **[`script`](/docs/plugins/event/script) plugin** — write event logic as a Python function when templates aren't enough.
- **[`replay`](/docs/plugins/event/replay) plugin** — replay events from existing log files with optional timestamp replacement.

### Template plugin enhancements

- **Faker & Mimesis** — two powerful data generation libraries available directly in templates (70+ locales, hundreds of data providers).
- **`module` gateway** — access any installed Python package in templates via `module.<package>`.
- **Global state** — new `globals` scope for sharing state across all generators (thread-safe).
- **New state methods** — `update`, `clear`, and `as_dict` for all state scopes.
- **New picking modes** — [`fsm`](/docs/core/concepts/producing#fsm) (finite state machine) and [`chain`](/docs/core/concepts/producing#chain) (fixed sequence).
- **New sample types** — `json` and `items` (inline lists in YAML).
- **Timezone-aware timestamps** — `timestamp` is now a proper `datetime` object, not a string.
- **Better subprocesses** — new `cwd`, `env`, and `timeout` options.

### Output plugins

- **[`clickhouse`](/docs/plugins/output/clickhouse) plugin** — write events directly to ClickHouse.
- **[`http`](/docs/plugins/output/http) plugin** — send events to any HTTP endpoint.
- **Formatters** — transform events before delivery with `plain`, `json`, `json-batch`, `template`, or `template-batch`.

### Existing output plugin improvements

- **File** — new `flush_interval`, `cleanup_interval`, `file_mode`, `write_mode`, `encoding`, and `separator` options.
- **Stdout** — new `flush_interval`, `stream`, `encoding`, and `separator` options.
- **OpenSearch** — new `connect_timeout`, `request_timeout`, `client_cert`, `client_cert_key`, and `proxy_url` options.

## ⚡ Performance

Batch processing across the entire pipeline — events are grouped into configurable batches between stages, dramatically reducing overhead and improving throughput compared to 1.x.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Expanded test coverage for all plugins, the core executor, configuration loading, and the CLI.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The entire project has been rebuilt from scratch:

- **Plugin system** — self-registering plugins with a consistent structure.
- **Async pipeline** — `uvloop` event loop with `janus` queues for efficient stage-to-stage communication.
- **Configuration** — Pydantic-based validation with `${params.*}` and `${secrets.*}` variable substitution.
- **CLI** — rebuilt with Click, options auto-generated from config models.
- **REST API** — new FastAPI-based API for programmatic control.
- **Eventum Studio** — brand-new React web UI for visual editing, debugging, and monitoring.

## 📝 Other changes

- 🔄 `sample` input plugin renamed to [`static`](/docs/plugins/input/static).
- 🔄 `jinja` event plugin renamed to [`template`](/docs/plugins/event/template).
- 📋 Structured logging via [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/) — supports plain-text and JSON output.
- 🛡️ Better error diagnostics — exceptions now carry structured context for easier troubleshooting.
