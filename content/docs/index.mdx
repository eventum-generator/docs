Eventum is a data generation platform that produces synthetic events and delivers them anywhere — in real time or in batch. Whether you need a continuous stream of application logs hitting your SIEM, a one-off dataset to seed a staging database, or a high-throughput workload to stress-test a pipeline, Eventum lets you describe *what* your data looks like and *when* it should appear, then takes care of the rest.

## Why Eventum

Building and testing data-driven systems usually means waiting for real data to accumulate or writing throwaway scripts that are hard to maintain and impossible to reuse. Eventum solves this by giving you a declarative way to generate realistic data on demand.

- **Realistic content** — templates powered by [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/) and [Mimesis](https://mimesis.name/) produce believable names, IPs, timestamps, and domain-specific values out of the box.
- **Precise timing** — generate events on a cron schedule, at fixed intervals, spread uniformly across a time range, or following complex statistical patterns that mimic real-world traffic.
- **Multiple destinations** — send events to stdout for quick debugging, write to files, or push directly to ClickHouse, OpenSearch, or any HTTP endpoint — all at the same time.
- **Live and batch modes** — stream events in real time at their actual timestamps, or generate an entire dataset as fast as possible.
- **Scalable by design** — run multiple generators in parallel, each with its own schedule, templates, and outputs. Manage them through a REST API or a built-in web UI.

## How it works

Every generator in Eventum runs a three-stage pipeline. You describe each stage in a simple YAML config — no code required for most use cases.

An **input plugin** produces timestamps — the moments when events should happen. A **event plugin** takes each timestamp and renders it into an actual event string using a template or a script. Finally, one or more **output plugins** deliver the resulting events to their destinations. This separation means you can swap any part independently: change the schedule without touching the template, or add a new output without modifying anything else.

## Quick example

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a template

Create a file `events.jinja` with the content you want to generate.
Templates use Jinja2 syntax and have access to built-in modules like
`faker` for realistic data. Each render receives a `timestamp` variable
with the exact moment the event should represent.

```jinja title="events.jinja"
{{ timestamp }} INFO  user={{ module.faker.user_name() }} action=login ip={{ module.faker.ipv4() }}
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Create a generator config

Create a file `generator.yml` that wires the three pipeline stages together.
This config uses a `cron` input that fires every second, the `template` event
plugin to render the template above, and `stdout` output to print results.

```yaml title="generator.yml"
input:
  - cron:
      expression: "* * * * * *"
      count: 1

event:
  template:
    mode: all
    templates:
      - my_event:
          template: events.jinja

output:
  - stdout: {}
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Run the generator

```bash
eventum generate --path generator.yml --live-mode
```

Events start printing to your terminal at one per second:

```
2025-06-15 12:00:01+00:00 INFO  user=jsmith action=login ip=192.168.44.12
2025-06-15 12:00:02+00:00 INFO  user=amiller action=login ip=10.0.128.55
2025-06-15 12:00:03+00:00 INFO  user=kwilson action=login ip=172.16.0.91
```

This example runs a single generator from the command line. To run multiple generators
with a server, API, and web UI, see the [`eventum run`](/docs/core/cli/eventum-run) command.
