description: Step-by-step walkthroughs that build complete Eventum projects from scratch — covering real-world use cases, every plugin type, and production patterns.
---

Each tutorial builds a complete, runnable project from an empty directory. You'll create configuration files, write templates, and see the output — no code is left unexplained.

## Before you start

Make sure Eventum is [installed](/docs/core/introduction/installation). If you want to follow along with output destinations (OpenSearch, ClickHouse, Telegram), have those services accessible — each tutorial lists its prerequisites up front.
